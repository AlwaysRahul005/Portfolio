  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Rahul Gayen, I am a B.Tech student of the Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM) Newtown, Kolkata. It does make me excited as I am technology enthusiast, and I am always willing to learn more about various concepts and ideas to able to make a difference. I am originally from Contai and have a combination of both academic focus as well as practical involvement in my course work and particulars. My fields of focus are intended to build up the expert knowledge as well as run a versatile career in engineering and technology. Due to my passion for reading, I am a curious person with a view of the world around me on a number of issues.

      Another of my interests is traveling because it always opens a great opportunity to see other countries, states, or even cities and consider their landscapes and people. I like taking these photos because it has become one of my exciting pastimes. What concerns me, maybe nature, cities or even people strolling by, I get the pleasure in narrating a story with a lens.
      
      I enjoy what I do and am eager to bring technical experience along with my leisure passions which are traveling and taking pictures.
